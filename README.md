Experiment on various multidocument summarization methods
---------------------------------------------------------

- evaluate classifical hand crafted relevance features 

- use linear score functions to evaluate relevance 

- learn feature weights using support vector machines trained on DUC conference datasets

- explore the use of neural sentence embeddings for identifying redundancy

- use linear score function to evaluate pairwise semantical redundancy of sentences

- tune the trade-off between relevance and redundancy on development data

- compare the use of A* search and Dynamic Programming to find best summary given score functions and trade-off
