Experiment on various multidocument summarization methods
---------------------------------------------------------

- evaluate classifical hand crafted relevance features 

- learn linear/non-linear models for relevance, training on DUC conference datasets

- explore the use of neural sentence embeddings for identifying redundancy

- tune the trade-off between relevance and redundancy on development data

- compare the use of A* search and Dynamic Programming to find best summary given score functions and trade-off
